## Detailed Explanation of top 9 Audio Features

### 1. **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**:
   - **`mfcc_1_mean`, `mfcc_2_mean`, `mfcc_3_mean`, `mfcc_4_mean`, `mfcc_7_mean`**:
     - **MFCCs** are coefficients that represent the short-term power spectrum of sound, based on a **Mel scale of frequency**.
     - **Mel scale** mimics the way humans perceive sound frequencies, making MFCCs a powerful feature for audio tasks like speech, music, or ambient sound classification.
     - The **mean** value for each coefficient over time is computed to summarize its behavior across the audio sample.
     - **Interpretation:**
       - MFCCs capture the **timbre** or **texture** of the sound.
       - Lower coefficients (`mfcc_1_mean`, `mfcc_2_mean`) correspond to the **broad structure** of the spectrum.
       - Higher coefficients (`mfcc_7_mean`, `mfcc_4_mean`) capture **finer details**.

### 2. **Spectral Centroid Mean (`spectral_centroid_mean`)**:
   - The **spectral centroid** is the "center of mass" of the spectrum.
   - It indicates where the **"center of gravity"** of the frequency distribution is located.
   - If the spectral centroid is high, the audio has more high frequencies (bright sound, like cymbals).
   - **Mean spectral centroid** represents the average centroid value over the entire audio clip.
   - **Interpretation:** Higher values indicate a **brighter or sharper sound**, while lower values indicate a **duller or bass-heavy sound**.

### 3. **Harmonic Root Mean Square (RMS) Energy (`harmonic_rms`)**:
   - **Harmonic RMS** is a measure of the energy in the **harmonic (pitched)** components of the sound.
   - It helps distinguish between sounds that have a clear pitch (like musical notes) versus noise or percussion (which may lack harmonic content).
   - **Interpretation:** Higher values suggest a more harmonic or pitched sound, while lower values suggest percussive, noisy, or less structured sound.

### 4. **Spectral Rolloff Mean (`spectral_rolloff_mean`)**:
   - **Spectral rolloff** is the frequency below which a certain percentage (typically 85%) of the total spectral energy is contained.
   - It captures how much of the audio's energy is concentrated in the higher frequencies.
   - **Mean spectral rolloff** provides the average rolloff frequency across the entire audio sample.
   - **Interpretation:** High rolloff values indicate that the sound contains a lot of **high-frequency content** (e.g., hi-hats), whereas low values indicate **low-frequency content** (e.g., bass notes).

### 5. **Zero-Crossing Rate Mean (`zcr_mean`)**:
   - **Zero-crossing rate (ZCR)** measures the number of times the signal's waveform crosses the zero amplitude line (i.e., changes sign from positive to negative or vice versa) per time window.
   - **Mean ZCR** gives the average zero-crossing rate over the entire audio clip.
   - **Interpretation:**
     - Higher ZCR values indicate **noisy, sharp, and percussive sounds** (e.g., claps, shakers).
     - Lower values indicate **smooth or harmonic sounds** (e.g., singing, sustained notes).

### 6. **Percussive Root Mean Square Energy (`percussive_rms`)**:
   - Similar to **harmonic RMS**, but this feature measures the **energy of percussive components** (transient, unpitched parts) in the sound.
   - **Interpretation:**
     - High percussive RMS indicates a sound rich in **transient events** (e.g., drums, clicks).
     - Low percussive RMS indicates **smoother or sustained sounds** (like humming or sine waves).

### 7. **Spectral Flatness Mean (`spectral_flatness_mean`)**:
   - **Spectral flatness** is a measure of how **noise-like** or **tonal** a sound is.
   - A value close to 1 indicates a **noisy, unpitched** sound (e.g., white noise), whereas a value close to 0 indicates a **purely tonal** sound.
   - **Mean spectral flatness** represents the average value over time.
   - **Interpretation:** Higher values correspond to more noise-like sounds, while lower values correspond to tonal or musical sounds.

### 8. **Onset Strength Mean (`onset_strength_mean`)**:
   - **Onset strength** measures the intensity of **onsets** (beginning of a sound or note) in the audio.
   - It captures how strong or sharp the beginnings of sounds are in the audio.
   - **Mean onset strength** provides the average strength of detected onsets across the entire audio.
   - **Interpretation:** Higher values indicate a sound with **distinct and sharp note attacks** (e.g., percussive beats), while lower values indicate **gradual or smooth changes** (e.g., ambient sound).

### 9. **Spectral Bandwidth Mean (`spectral_bandwidth_mean`)**:
   - **Spectral bandwidth** measures the **range of frequencies** present in the sound.
   - It is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies that contribute to the spectral energy.
   - **Mean spectral bandwidth** provides the average bandwidth over time.
   - **Interpretation:**
     - A **large spectral bandwidth** indicates the presence of **both high and low frequencies** (e.g., complex music or environmental sounds).
     - A **small spectral bandwidth** suggests sounds that are **narrow in frequency content** (e.g., a pure tone or sine wave).
